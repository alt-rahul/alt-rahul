ðŸ‘‹ Hello, it's me, Rahul!

This is my alternative/new account, hence, `alt-rahul`. If you want to view my original account, [click here](https://github.com/rahuls-coding) I will attempt to do cool stuff here _or 
embarrassingly screw up_, with math and cs. 

I appreciate visiting my profile (or somehow finding it), so as a gift, enjoy [this](https://shattereddisk.github.io/rickroll/rickroll.mp4).

alt-rahul/alt-rahul is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
